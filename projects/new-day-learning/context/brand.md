## 1. Visual Identity

### Logos
We prioritize a **Clean, Simple, and Minimal** aesthetic.
*   **Primary Logo:** `context/assets/logo_full_color.png` (Use on white backgrounds)
*   **Icon:** `context/assets/logo_icon.png` (Sun + Book symbol, use for favicons/avatars)

### Color Palette
Derived from our logo (Sun, Growth, Trust):

| Color Name | Hex Code | Usage | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **New Day Orange** | `#FF8C00` | Primary Buttons, Highlights | Energy, Warmth, New Beginnings |
| **Growth Green** | `#32CD32` | Success States, Accents | Growth, Nature, Learning |
| **Trust Blue** | `#0056D2` | Headers, Links, Primary Text | Reliability, Stability, Wisdom |
| **Slate Neutral** | `#64748B` | Body Text, Borders | Professionalism, Balance |
| **Clean White** | `#FFFFFF` | Backgrounds, Cards | Simplicity, Clarity |

### Typography
We use clean, sans-serif fonts to maximize readability for all abilities.
*   **Headings:** `Inter` (Bold/SemiBold) - Modern and approachable.
*   **Body:** `Inter` (Regular) - High legibility.
*   **Alternative:** `Roboto` or `Open Sans` if Inter is unavailable.

## 2. Voice & Tone
Our voice is **Supportive, Clear, and Adult**.
We speak to our users (adults with special needs) with respect, never condescension.

| Do Say | Don't Say |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Support your goals" | "Help you function" |
| "Skill development" | "Fixing behaviors" |
| "Participants" or "Adults" | "Kids" or "Patients" |
| "Simple and clear" | "Overly complex jargon" |

## 3. UI Guidelines
When building dashboards or apps:

*   **Layouts:** Use heavily spaced, card-based layouts (Shadcn Cards).
*   **Touch Targets:** Buttons must be large (`h-10` or higher) for motor accessibility.
*   **Contrast:** Always ensure high contrast (White text on Blue/Orange buttons).
*   **Simplicity:** Avoid clutter. One primary action per screen.
*   **Radius:** Use `rounded-xl` for a friendly, soft feel.

## 4. Accessibility (A11y)
**Crucial:** Our user base has diverse needs.
1.  **Alt Text:** All images must have descriptive alt text.
2.  **Focus States:** Interactive elements must have clear focus rings.
3.  **Readability:** No text smaller than `14px`. Use `16px+` for body text.
